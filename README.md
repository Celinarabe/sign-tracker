## Tech Stack

ReactJS, Google Firebase (Auth, Firestore, Storage), and Google Maps API
## Background
I was inspired to create Photo Mapper while volunteering for a political campaign. One of our biggest pain points was managing and storing the location of all of the yard signs and marketing materials. My solution, Photo Mapper, removes the need for manual entries, and allows for easy collaboration in the cloud. 

Even though this app was inspired by my personal volunteer experience, I decided to make the app more generic in order to reach a wider audience, hence the name change from "Sign Tracker" to "Photo Mapper". Overall, I enjoyed solving a problem that was close to me as this gave me a better idea of the problem I was trying to solve and it was super easy to get immediate feedback!

I encourage anyone who is looking to create personal projects to solve a problem that is close to them. Inspiration may be closer than you think!

## Project Planning
Any well intentioned project should have a thorough planning phase. Arguably, planning takes longer than the actual building of the tool. Planning Photo Mapper involved:
* Fleshing out the idea and motivation - What exact problem are we trying to solve? The answer to this question helped guide everything else to follow.
* Outlining requirements and MVP - What features do we absolutely need to make this work?
* Creating Database Schema - What tables do we need? How will security be built in?

## Project Design
* Find inspiration - A site I love is [Dribbble](https://dribbble.com/) where you can search for any kind of app you can think of.
* Mock ups - Everyone knows and loves Figma for a reason. I watched a 1-hour long Youtube video covering Figma basics and the investment has paid off big time. I recommend [Kevin Powell's video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eZJOSK4gXl4).

That's it for now! I'm off working on other things, but this project will always have a special place in my heart as my first full stack web app
